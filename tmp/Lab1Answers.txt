What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies and the original scheduling policy in XINU?

Advantages of XINU policy -
Easy logic, easy to understand and implement.
Process with highest priority gets executed first.

Disadvantage of XINU policy -
Starvation, lower priority processes don't get enough execution time and maybe denied execution time completely if a high priority process is running.

Linux Scheduler advantages -
Starvation is low, even low priority process get execution time.

Disadvantage of Linux Scheduler -
Takes lots of time - overhead with regards to computation.

Advantages of Multi-queue scheduler -
Real time processes get more execution time, normal processes do not starve.

Disadvantages of Multiqueue scheduler -
Random number generation is used, its probabilistic, dependent on seed value.
